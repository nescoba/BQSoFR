what can we possibly say about this? How to understand the fact that the AL has a scale parameter and yet it fits the correct regression coefficients without it 

the reason is that there is ambiguity. If I tell you that the median of a distribution is at 0, I'm giving you limited information. We don't know skewness 
and we don't know scale. And that should impact our assesments. 

Skeweness kind of doesn't come into play. Oh, actually it does: if the tail to the right of the distribution is much longer, there is more room for uncertainty to the right. Similarly, the scale should give us the scale of the uncertainty. 

I actually think I'm onto something here
