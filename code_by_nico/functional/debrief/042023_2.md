## Big Picture

- Before we run any simulations, we need to think this through
- Lan had some fundamental objections to our set up (not even about the functional part)
- Her comments made me think about what this paper is trying to say

<!-- ## Let's take a step back -->

## Lan's first point 

- Simplified setting:
    - Covariates $\mathbf{x}_i$
    - Response $Y_i$

<!-- - One of Lan's question was about why GAL over AL? She has a point 
    - If we assume 
        \begin{equation*}
        Y_i \sim f_{\mathrm{AL}_\tau}(\lambda_{0, \tau} + \mathbf{x}^T \boldsymbol \lambda_{1, \tau}, \sigma)
        \end{equation*} 
        then the MLE estimators for $\boldsymbol \lambda$ are the same estimates that we obtain in frequentist QR
    - We move away from that by saying that we're now going to assume 
        \begin{equation*}
        Y_i \sim \lambda_{0, \tau} + \mathbf{x}^T \boldsymbol \lambda_{1,\tau} + \epsilon_i
        \end{equation*}
        where $\epsilon_i \sim \mathrm{GAL}_\tau(0, \sigma, \gamma)$ -->

<!-- ## Lan's first point -->

<!-- - By moving away, we have lost the connection with the frequentist estimates 
- We say: since $Q_\tau(\epsilon_i) = 0$, so we still have 
    $Q_\tau(Y_i|\mathbf{x}_i) = \lambda_{0, \tau} + \mathbf{x}^T \boldsymbol \lambda_{1,\tau}$
- To which Lan replied: any distribution for $\epsilon_i$ with the property $Q_\tau(\epsilon_i) = 0$ will give you that. 
- What does $\mathrm{GAL}_\tau$ offer that $\mathrm{N}(0,1) - q_{.25}$ doesn't?
- We can only reply: it's what has been done, it's what has been used and seems to work
- No theoretical reason
- It is a fundamental problem with BQR: we need a likelihood, and we pick it in a rather arbitrary way -->
<!-- 
## A concrete example  -->

- Suppose the true distribution is 
    \begin{equation*}
    Y_i = \beta_0 + \mathbf{x}_i^T \boldsymbol \beta_1 + \delta_i
    \end{equation*}
    where $\delta_i \sim \mathrm{N}(0,1)$
- If we model this as 
    \begin{equation*}
    Y_i \sim \lambda_{0, \tau} + \mathbf{x}^T \boldsymbol \lambda_{1,\tau} + \epsilon_i
    \end{equation*}
    where $\epsilon_i \sim \mathrm{AL}_\tau(0, \sigma, \gamma)$ then if we choose *flat* priors, the posterior mode of $\boldsymbol\lambda | \mathbf x$ coincides with the frequentist QR estimates.

- In formulas 
    \begin{equation*}
    E[\mathrm{Mode}(\lambda_{0, \tau}|\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})] = \beta_0 + z_{\tau} 
    \end{equation*}
    and 
    \begin{equation*}
    E[\mathrm{Mode}(\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{1, \tau}|\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})] = \boldsymbol{\beta}_{1,\tau}
    \end{equation*}
- If we move to 
    \begin{equation*}
    Y_i \sim \lambda'_{0, \tau} + \mathbf{x}^T \boldsymbol \lambda'_{1,\tau} + \epsilon'_i
    \end{equation*}
    where $\epsilon'_i \sim \mathrm{GAL}_\tau(0, \sigma, \gamma)$, we loose this property, especially if we use priors

---

- This is bad! 
- We seem to be saying that the second model fits the data better because it's more flexible
- But what's the connection between $\boldsymbol{\lambda}'_{1,\tau}| \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}$?
- The benefit of the Bayesian framework is that it gives us a distribution. But what is that distribution telling us?

# A possible answer 

## Model the likelihood!

- BQR is completely agnostic about the true likelihood
- In reality, we have some idea about it. Or at least we try to make assumptions about it
- Our assumption is a perfectly reasonable one:
    \begin{equation*}
    Y_i = \beta_0 + \mathbf{x}_i^T \boldsymbol{\beta}_1 + \exp\left(\mathbf{x}_i^T \boldsymbol{\eta}\right) \delta_i
    \end{equation*}
    where $\delta_i \sim \mathrm{N}(0,1)$
- For small $\mathbf{\eta}$
    \begin{equation*}
    Q_\tau(Y_i|\mathbf{x}_i) \approx \beta_0 + z_{\tau} + \mathbf{x}_i^T(\boldsymbol{\beta}_1 + z_{\tau}\boldsymbol{\eta})
    \end{equation*}
