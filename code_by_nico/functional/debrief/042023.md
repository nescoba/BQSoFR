I do need to think this through. 

There is a long discussion to be had here because there are a lot of issues. There is the issue of the relation between the lambdas, betas and gammas. There is the question of whether this is truly about functional data or about Bayesian quantile regression. There is a question of whether we really need simulations, or this is a theoretical paper. And if it is a theoretical paper, we need some more math. 

There is one version of this where we say: you know what?
