## Quantile Regression for Censored data

The goal is to build a model to estimate the quantile function in a case of censored data outcome where the covariates are prone to measurement error (functional covariates).

-   We want to consider the case where the functional covariate is mixture of zero and positive part

-   We want to consider the case where we don't have replicates but we have instrumental variables. We want to implement a zero inflated aware Bayesian FUI or regression calibration approach.

-   We want to consider the case where we estimate quantile jointly
